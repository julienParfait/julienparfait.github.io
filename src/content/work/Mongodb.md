##### Overview 


**Product Recommendation System for E-Commerce, Insurance and Finance Platforms**

##### Background and general presentation

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Digital finance and e-commerce are sectors experiencing exponential growth, and in an increasingly competitive environment, differentiation is essential to attract and retain customers. Users now expect a fluid, personalised shopping experience, tailored to their specific preferences and needs. It is against this backdrop that recommendation systems have emerged as essential solutions for meeting customer expectations, while increasing the profitability and competitiveness of online retailers.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The aim of this project is to implement a product recommendation system using MongoDB, a flexible and high-performance NoSQL database adapted to the storage and analysis needs of large, unstructured data. This solution will make it possible to design relevant recommendations based on purchasing behaviour, interactions with the site and explicit user preferences, for an optimised customer experience.
