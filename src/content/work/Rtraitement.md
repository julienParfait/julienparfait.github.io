#### Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I'm developing a package called **Datawrangling** for data exploration in a single line of code. The aim of this package is to facilitate the actions that are most often carried out when you receive a database and want to do a summary exploration, the very first exploration. This package includes the **wrangling** function, which, when applied to a database of any format, provides general analyses of the database. These include the number of rows, columns, the type of each variable, analysis of missing values, extreme values, graphs for different types of variables, distributions and much more.

Code and library will be available soon.
