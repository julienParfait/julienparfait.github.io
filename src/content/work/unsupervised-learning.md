#### Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Clustering is an analysis method that involves dividing a set of data into homogeneous groups, called clusters, based on similarities between observations. Each cluster brings together elements with common characteristics. Clustering is a valuable tool for segmenting a population (customers, patients, regions, etc.) so as to adapt specific strategies to each group. For example, a company can use clustering to segment its customer base according to behavioural or needs criteria, enabling it to optimise its marketing efforts by personalising its offers.

How it works: Simply import a database (.xlsx or .csv format) and follow the steps one by one. In a paragraph and a few lines, and without writing any code, you'll have learned how to do clustering.
