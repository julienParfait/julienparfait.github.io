##### Description 

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The main objective is to develop a model capable of detecting potentially fraudulent transactions in real time, thereby reducing financial losses and improving customer security. By analysing historical data, this model can identify patterns of fraudulent behaviour and anticipate future fraud attempts.
