#####  Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this project I am developing an interactive web application for data analysis and unsupervised learning. The application covers a fairly wide range of topics and can be useful for many companies using evidence-based decision-making. Simple and easy to use, it allows you to track indicators and identify key graphical trends during a field survey or online (useful for monitoring and evaluation). What's more, by allowing users to import their own database, it can automate the analysis process if new surveys are carried out.
