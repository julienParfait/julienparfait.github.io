This dashboard project provides a comprehensive overview of access to drinking water around the world, highlighting the inequalities and challenges associated with water quality by country and by continent. It centralises key indicators such as the population with access to drinking water, the distribution of this population according to the maintenance of water infrastructures, as well as the mortality rate and the number of deaths due to non-drinking water. By integrating global data such as political stability and total population, this dashboard enables a detailed analysis of the factors that influence access to quality water.
