#### Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This interactive application presents socio-demographic analyses of survey data, as well as monitoring and evaluation indicators and economic aggregates.
</p>

It proposes:
<br>

- 📊 Univariate analyses: for example, the breakdown of the sample by geographical area, gender, level of education, and much more.

<br>

- 🔍 Cross-tabulated statistics: analysis of socio-professional categories by place of residence or level of education, and breakdown of the working population by gender.

<br>

- 🗺️ Interactive mapping: display of all indicators at sub-regional level, with the option of carrying out analyses by region or department.

<br>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Ideal for presenting non-technical results and the main trends of a study to a wide audience. 🌍 Finally, it is possible to download the dataset as required (according to the number of rows, the number of columns or through filters).
