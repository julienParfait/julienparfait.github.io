##### Description 

<p style="text-align: justify;">
In these STATA scripts, I am updating eight databases of harmonised surveys on household living conditions within the West African Economic and Monetary Union. I analyse duplicates, missing values, joins of the eight databases, consistency checks, handling anomalies, reordering, assigning labels, splitting into classes, and so on.
