####  Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
An NGO has decided to support the country of Senegal in its fight against food insecurity in rural areas in a post-covid context, particularly in the areas of the Groundnut Basin and Casamance. After carrying out a series of studies to determine the mechanism by which the support would take shape, the NGO's experts propose two alternatives:
</p>

- Funding of 500,000 CFA francs for specific expenses.
- A consignment of food kits containing 150 kg of rice, 25 kg of sugar, 50 kg of onions and 25 litres of oil
- This intervention is part of the partnerships signed between the NGO and sub-Saharan countries with a view to participating in the development process.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Objectives:
</p>

- The general objective of the WAKANDA government's support is to substantially improve the level of food insecurity in the Groundnut Basin and Casamance Specifically, 3 objectives are being pursued
